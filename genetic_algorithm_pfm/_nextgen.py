    Tournament selection

    Function that selects parents for next generation. The score of a random parent is taken as reference value. Next,
    a tournament is held to check if from a random list of scores, a better score can be obtained. If so, this becomes
    the parent to beat. The parent with the lowest score is returned in the end.

    The random selection means that a single member of the population can be selected zero, one, or multiple times!

    k defines the length of the tournament. A higher k means the tournament is taking more time, but the convergence
    rate look higher. A sensitivity study will be conducted to see the influence of k.
